# City Weather Checker

This is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather in any city. It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch weather data and display it in a user-friendly interface. The app shows information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather description for the specified city.

## Features
- Enter the name of any city to get the current weather.
- Displays weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
- Easy-to-use interface with responsive design.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following:
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- An internet connection to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Files Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the application.
- `assets/css/styles.css`: CSS file that styles the webpage for a clean and modern look.
- `assets/js/main.js`: JavaScript file that handles the weather fetching and display logic.

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key**
   - Go to the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api).
   - Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

   - Copy the respective code into the files as described in the project.

3. **Add the API Key to `main.js`**
   Replace the `apiKey` variable in `assets/js/main.js` with your own OpenWeatherMap API key. Find this line:

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace this with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
